Boy , you amaze me .	7	8
There's no reason for anyone to come after me .	3	8

Tell [PERSON] to wait in the shop for me .	8	1
I'll tear it out of the calendar .	1	1
I can't tell you that !	1	1
And when it comes time for her to marry ... well , she'll be a little princess .	2	2
And now , he wants to buy me ?	2	1
What's Zharkov doing on the plane ?	7	7

It may bring you serious trouble .	4	4
Oh , this is so cool !	2	5
Let me talk to her again .	2	2
Why should I give a crap ?	1	1
Who bow and smile and scrape and spend their nights gnawing the chairs and floors out from under us all .	3	1
Okay ? - We're not dead yet ?	4	2
I don't say that with any kind of blame or accusation , but that is when it started .	6	1
Did you really think he would come with you ?	1	2
I've never felt more alive in my whole life .	5	6
What ? Get off my coat !	1	1
The question is what are you doing here ?	1	7
Perhaps that's why I'm incapable of having a child .	4	6
Cody , wait !	4	1
It is well .	5	8
If that horse would run tomorrow ,	2	2
There's my favourite little boy .	8	5
I'm trying to clean up the party . Our party . And I end up speaking out of turn .	6	1
So alone .	6	6
And don't try anything funny , cos you know what you'll get .	1	8
He says it's dangerous to spend the night in the village .	4	1

Somebody will listen to me .	2	1
My mommy hurt my head .  	4	6

Stole my Tintoretto . and my [PERSON] . And it has taken all [PERSON]'s bronze [LOCATION] the Countess .	1	1
I could have saved time and liquor by doing this in my office , but it needs a little ceremony .	2	8
It's dangerous jouncing Mrs. [PERSON] over open country .	4	2
My unit's due to be shipped out soon .	6	2
In which case , you'd be throwing out decades of disarmament progress .	1	1
Prisoner has a right to escape , hasn't he ?	2	2
Don't worry , kid !	8	8
You know ... Sometimes I even amaze myself .	8	6
I'd give my soul to go , but I can't .	6	1
You're not just a crook , but a murderer .	1	1
He's still emotionally unstable .	4	8
I'm sure you'll need them if you're gonna go into rats in detail .	8	8
You shut up , Dude , and listen to me .	1	1
Right there ... in those big blue eyes .	8	8
That's right .	5	8
Morphine syrette . Give me a morphine syrette . I got it .	5	8
I broke my glasses .	6	1
Welcome to [LOCATION] , ma'am .	5	2
You're nuts !	4	1
Myself . When I am in possession of my faculties and [PERSON] is not .	1	1

Your famous [PERSON] is safe .	2	8
You are dead inside .	3	4
Am I sure ?	4	4
I am the avenger .	5	1
No , no , no , I don't mean that .	7	8
It hurts me when people laugh at you .	6	1
But I had locked the briefcase of the [PERSON] in the morning following to her death .	3	6
I can't seem to keep you two out of the hospital lately .	1	6
I do not like Mr. [PERSON] .	1	1
I killed this person for their money , right ?	7	4
Thank you , Mr. [PERSON] .	5	8
Cheese doodles !	2	1
Maybe we'll get lucky .	2	2
They're here .	2	1
He never even heard of [PERSON] .	7	1
I rehearse my story . I try to think of all the questions they'll ask .	7	1
Hey , you know me .	5	5
Before proceeding further , I'll remind the visitors in the gallery that they are here as our guests and should conduct themselves as such .	3	1
What's the idea of turning her down ?	7	1
Well , now , there's a lovable chap .	5	8
Let me out , or I'll kill myself .	4	1
We're realists , knowing that we're on the outside looking in . - We calmly accept our uncertain position . - Yeah .	8	8
I killed her ! I killed her like she was an animal .	2	3
At my age , corrected by an illiterate .	3	3
There's some hot biscuits in the warmer .	8	5
[PERSON] , what the hell have you done to the coffee ?	3	1
The clerk will call the roll .	2	1
I'm getting darned sick of the way she's acting .	1	1
You do not deny , then , that such a monster could exist . Is that correct ?	1	1
If I was you , I would go home and talk to your family people .	8	1
Interesting problem we got on this one :	2	2
Their privilege , their presumption .	6	1
Think I'm a fool ?	1	1
m glad for you . 	8	5
[PERSON]'s looking for a new assistant and wants to meet you for a drink .	2	2
Oh , you little beauty !	5	5
[PERSON] , don't try it .	1	1
We got ta stick together , cos what are we ?	2	8
By the way ...	4	8
What'd he die of ?	8	4
She got what she deserves .	3	8

We come from a good family My name is Windy	2	8
I think that about covers it for now .	5	1
Don't lose no sweat , Kid .	8	8
Who's afraid of a little booger ?	3	4
Because I watched [PERSON] go through exactly what you're going through right now .	2	1
You just wait .	1	2
I went off because I gained like six pounds ,	6	5
I have improved it .	5	8
We're fools to tolerate it .	1	1
Are you confessing to this ?	1	7
Assuming that the captain's conduct often showed bad judgement . - - Would that be inconsistent with your diagnosis of him ?	2	2
You're gonna need weapons , all of you .	4	4
[PERSON] wrote something awful nice .	5	5
Wait !	2	1
For your next fight , try the redhead in the front row .	2	2

I'm very excited , [PERSON] .	2	6
What's the latest ?	2	2
Where did she get a bag to match those shoes ?	2	7
Why should I answer ?	1	7
Now there's a thought ....	2	7
That's the fairest drink of whiskey you'll ever throw lip over , boy .	5	5
You've got to be realistic .	1	8
For God's sakes , put yourself in my position .	1	1

You only pretended to be my friend .	6	8
You skin will look and feel a whole lot better .	2	2
I want to feel my bones burst into a billion pieces !	2	3
You're not going to hang me ?	7	1
You may have overlooked the fact that the use of officers for labour is expressly forbidden by the Geneva Convention .	1	8
If that's what the grown - ups have done with this world , we have to start those boys ' camps and see what the kids can do .	6	1
You think I'll let her out when you'll have her around people like [PERSON] ?	3	1

Is that all right with you ?	2	2
Nice questions you ask .	8	1
I'd say you were the only man I ever loved .	6	6
It had to be filled with love .	2	5
How much simpler it would be , for so many of us , if [PERSON] had not found it necessary to look for a new face .	1	2
There were some problems with ...	6	4
Do you mean he'd never seen a clock before ?	7	7
You couldn't leave your girl ?	7	1
This time it is you who does not understand . I know [PERSON] better than you do .	1	1
Rushing home to a hot apartment to listen to the automatic laundry and the electric dishwasher and the garbage disposal and the nagging wife .	3	1
That dated us , all right , but it gave us something to do .	2	4
Crazy out of your skull .	3	3
Die , you bastard !	1	1
I didn't jump .	7	6
The point is of no return ... and you've reached it !	1	1
What do you mean something struck her ?	2	7
I want you to take care of someone for me .	8	8
There's nothing I can do about squabbles in the imperial court	1	6
But , God , people can be rude .	3	3
Come on , [PERSON] !	2	1
Feel better ?	6	5
So I hit the casino floor , I'm walking out , heart's in my mouth .	4	1
Where is [PERSON] ?	1	2
I'm sorry , Rock .	6	6
You mean to say I have this all to myself ?	7	2

But we have a hotplate and a well - stocked refrigerator .	5	2
He'll be a champ .	2	8
Look out !	4	5
No ! There's no place like home .	1	1
Maybe this goddamn bastard of an election will get itself resolved .	1	1
I'll give you a minute and seconds .	1	1
Whatever your love wishes me to be , whatever is in your heart .	8	8
No , these are mine , I gave you money .	1	6
We're being wiped out !	4	1
I just thought I'd drop by and cheer you up a bit .	5	5
Hurry up !	1	1

In front of millions . That didn't stop [PERSON] . [PERSON] , remember ...	8	8
It's for your own good .	8	5
I'll see you tomorrow .	8	2

Join my class ?	2	2
You darling , [PERSON] !	5	7
Do you accuse me , Mr. [PERSON] ?	1	2

Just look at her . Look at the size of her .	4	2
Nobody knows what goes on inside a police car , right , [PERSON] ?	3	2

What kind of an answer is that against a $ million world gross ? You don't say .	7	7
The suspect's body , who we now believe is our Jack the Ripper copycat , was discovered late last night .	7	6
If we push this , who are we pushing against ?	2	1

I don't wan na go like this .	6	2
The bus , the bus !	7	1
Are you suggesting that I killed those women ?	4	7
Then you weren't angry because I wasn't there ?	7	1

I've no other place to go .	4	2
An odd coincidence , both of you turning up here .	7	4
I failed you .	6	1
I do not hide the truth .	8	1
I don't want to die .	4	6
Well , if you want anything , just ring .	8	8

I'll pay both of you .	8	1
She believes that her father has incestuous desires .	3	8
Both those guys on the trailer are in it .	3	3

Oh , I almost forgot .	7	7
There's no more running .	1	4
And it's the truth , of course .	8	8
Don't let it beat you .	8	1
I don't see any reason why this witness should not be qualified to give evidence .	8	1
Soon we will expand from city to city .	2	2
But the neighbours will know we've adopted .	4	8
It all began one night when the lights went out. ,	2	6
I'll see if I can get through .	8	1
Let's drink to something .	2	2
There's something terrible happening in there .	4	4
It is infernal !	1	1

All engines ahead full .	2	2
Spring's gonna be early .	2	2
Thank you for stopping , you saved my life !	8	5
Simply gorgeous .	8	5
What can I do for you ?	8	7
I thought I knew all of Grandpa's friends but I don't seem to recognize you .	7	7
Who would want to live in a graveyard ?	3	1
What did [PERSON] say to get you so upset ?	6	1
I don't know where I'd be with this bill if it wasn't for your help .	8	8
Whoever it was The family honor him [PERSON] prevent flaunt it .	2	8
His body and clothes soaked in blood ?	4	1
Suppose I could prove it to you . Suppose I asked you for your help . Would you give it to me , without telling anybody , not saying anything to anyone ?	7	6
Does it mean you want me to go there ?	7	2
Don't call me commander .	1	4
Go ! Go !	2	1
Profane , or really offensive ?	1	7

All right , is that a beautiful city or what ?	5	5
There was no way I could get in touch with my husband .	4	8
You think you're pretty smart , don't you ?	3	3

He'll kill me if he has to .	4	1
This is real nice .	5	5
Don't listen to her !	4	1
I declare , [PERSON] , sometimes I think you got psychic powers .	4	8
The odds against survival in this camp are even worse .	4	1
That's odd .	7	8
What do you say , cousin ?	2	7
That's normal . That's what she should be doing .	8	1
Hey , Beef , if [PERSON] says the van was empty , the van was empty .	1	6
